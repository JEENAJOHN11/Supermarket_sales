# Supermarket_sales

In today's retail landscape, understanding customer behavior is crucial for supermarkets. This project focuses on a supermarket sales dataset, aiming to classify customers into different types based on their transaction history and demographics.

Our primary target is the "Customer type" variable, and our goal is to develop a classification model that accurately assigns customers to their respective categories. We will explore the data, preprocess it, and leverage various classification techniques to achieve this objective.

The outcome of this project not only enhances prediction accuracy but also enables supermarkets to better understand and serve their customers by tailoring their strategies to individual preferences and behaviors.
